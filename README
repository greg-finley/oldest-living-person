# Oldest Living Person

Watch [Wikipedia's list of oldest living people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_living_people) in a periodic job.

Tweet when there's a new oldest person.

Initial idea for the logic is keep a database of the seen top spots and tweet if the top spot has a *birth date* we have not yet seen (hedge against Wikipedia changing the *name* of the person in the top spot and triggering an errant tweet).
